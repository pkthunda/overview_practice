-Developers can create/edit/delete other developers.
-Developers can create/edit/delete projects.
-Developers can create/edit/delete time entries for themselves, not for other -developers.
-No one can delete a developer once that developer has made a time entry.
-No one can delete a project once that project has a time entry on it.
-There must be a project list page which:
  Includes a total number of hours worked on each project.
